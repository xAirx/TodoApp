# Project description

  The idea is to simulate a task given to me  refactoring a smaller application
  With this project i'm seeking to

  Rewrite one of my existing projects into TypeScript and introducing typesafety.

  Introducing the concepts of custom hooks

  Introducting the concepts of designprinciples coupled with functional programming

  Introducing the concept of performance considerations based on the knowledge of how React "reacts" and renders.

  I want to unit-test my components and have them run before my CI/CD deploys to heroku.

  I want to provide a documentation so that another developer can take over my project easily

  Live environments:

  Development
  https://todoapp--dev.herokuapp.com/

  Production
  https://todoapp--master.herokuapp.com/
