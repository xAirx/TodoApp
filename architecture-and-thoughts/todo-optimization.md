# TODO: Optimization

> React enables web applications to update their user interfaces \(UIs\) quickly, but that does not mean your medium or large React application will perform efficiently.

> Its performance will depend on how you use React when building it, and on your understanding of how React operates and the process through which components live through the various phases of their life-cycle.

> React offers a lot of performance improvements to a web app, and you can achieve these improvements through various techniques, features, and tools.

## TODO REWRITE: Why do we need optimizations?

React rendering & problems with it.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="TLDR" %}
Since React renders "Reactively" based on state, passing props and more , its important to be able to control renders throughout larger projects for performance reasons.

Parent components will trigger child component re-renders, and diffing on previous  props and next props can trigger  renders which we forexample want to happen when specific props changes or,  passed props to a function.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Longer Read" %}
Rendering is the process during which React moves down the component tree starting at the root, looking for all the components flagged for update, asking them to describe their desired UI structure based on the current combination of props and state.

For each flagged component, React will call its render\(\) method \(for class components\) or FunctionComponent\(\) \(for function components\), and save the output produced after converting the JSX result into a plain JS object, using React.createElement\(\).

After collecting the render output from the entire component tree,

React will diff the new tree \(the virtual DOM\) with the current DOM tree and collect the list of changes that need to be made to the DOM to produce the desired UI structure.

If the new state of the VDOM requires a UI change, the ReactDOM library will efficiently do this by trying to update only what needs to be updated.

For example, if only the attribute of an element changes, React will only update the attribute of the HTML element by calling document.setAttribute \(or something similar\).

When the VDOM gets updated, React compares it to to a previous snapshot of the VDOM and then only updates what has changed in the real DOM.

If nothing changed, the real DOM won't be updated at all.

 This process of comparing the old VDOM with the new one is called diffing.

Real DOM updates are slow because they cause an actual re-draw of the UI.

 React makes this more efficient by updating the smallest amount possible in the real DOM.

React's default behavior is to recursively render all child components inside of it when a parent component is rendered.

This means that it does not care if a component's props have changed - as long as the parent component rendered, its children will render unconditionally.

To put this another way, calling setState\(\) in the root component without any other changes, will cause React to re-render every single component in the component tree.

Most likely, most of the components will return the exact same render output as the last render, \(PURE COMPONENTS\)  meaning React will not have to make any changes to the DOM, but the rendering and diffing calculations will be performed regardless, taking time and effort.

React has to run its diffing algorithm on each of those components to check whether it should update the UI.

All your code in these render functions or function components will be executed again.

The first point is arguably not that important since React manages to calculate the difference quite efficiently.

The danger lies in the code that you wrote is being executed over and over on every React render.

This is why we need optimizations

There a couple ways that triggers react to rerender but

## TODO REWRITE Controlling when a component should update

MyTheme.TSX which includes the useColorMode Hook, and useTodoState which includes the useTodos hook.

Apparent issues a re-render will happen regardless if props have changed or not, when it comes to child components.

### useMemo and useCallback

useCallback\(\) and useMemo\(\) are React hooks that return memoized functions and values, respectively.

> An optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

These two hooks are the same, useCallback\(\) is simply a shorthand for using useMemo\(\) when it returns a function.

They both take a callback function as their first argument and an array of dependencies as their second.

When these dependencies change, the passed callback function will run, thus returning an updated value.

This happens while the component is rendering, itâ€™s important to keep that in mind so that no side effects occur inside of these hooks since that will cause more re-renders and decrease performance.

SideEffects should be provided to UseEffect since useEffect is the hook that runs side-effects independently of rendering. after each completed render or fire them when certain values have changed  \(dependency array\)
