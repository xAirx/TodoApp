## Project introduction

### The idea is to simulate a task given to me  refactoring a smaller application



**With this project i'm seeking to**   
  
Rewrite one of my existing projects into TypeScript and introducing typesafety.

Introducing the concepts of custom hooks

Introducting the concepts of designprinciples coupled with functional programming

Introducing the concept of performance considerations based on the knowledge of how React "reacts" and renders.

I want to measure and see the performance increase.

I want to unit-test my components and have them run before my CI/CD deploys to heroku.

**I want to provide a documentation so that another developer can take over my project easily.**
