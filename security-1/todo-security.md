# TODO: Security



**React provides its own security measures.**

\*\*\*\*

**How  and why would we want to circumvent the built in React security?**

Say a client has an API that returns a bunch of HTML again this is not ideal,  **but it could happen. here we would have to use dangerouslySetInnerHTML to make sure we can map it into our frontend.** 

> **The above would not be as dangerous as allowing tags, or having no clientside or serverrside validation.**

## Implemented security measures
