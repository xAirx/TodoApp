## **What is reuseable code?**

**Security**

To be reused, code needs to be secure

#### See the below section on security



**Reliability**

To be reused, code needs to be reliable. You can ensure reliable code by ensuring availability, fault tolerance, and recoverability.

**Performance Efficiency**

To be reused, code needs to be efficient. You can ensure efficiency by improving response times and monitoring processor, memory, and utilization.

**Maintainability**

## Testing

To be reused, code needs to be maintainable. One way to ensure that code is maintainable is to ensure it is compliant.
